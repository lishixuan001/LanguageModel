The alleged shooter, a 19-year-old woman, was in custody. The shooting happened about 7:20 p.m. in the 2700 block of West Potomac Avenue, police said. The officer, part of the Grand Central District tactical unit, was taken to Stroger Hospital. While officers were serving a \\\"typical\\\" search warrant for \\\"narcotics and illegal weapons\\\" and were attempting to reach a rear door, \\\"a shot was fired,\\\" striking the tactical officer in the shoulder, said Chicago police Superintendent Eddie Johnson during a news briefing outside the hospital. He said the officer, who has about four or five years on the job, was \\\"stable\\\" but in critical condition. \\\"His family is here,\\\" Johnson said. \\\"He’s talking a lot and just wants the ordeal to be over.\\\" He said this incident serves as just another reminder of how dangerous a police officer’s job is. At the scene of the shooting, crime tape closed Potomac from Washtenaw Avenue to California Avenue and encompassed the alley west of the brick apartment building, south of Potomac. Dozens of officers stood in the alley, while even more walked up and down the street. Neighbors gathered at the edge of the yellow tape on the sidewalk along California and watched them work. Standing next to a man, a woman talked to police in the crime scene, across the street. \\\"We're not under arrest? We can go?\\\" the woman checked with officers. They told her she could go, and she and the man walked underneath the yellow tape and out of the crime scene.\"\n",
